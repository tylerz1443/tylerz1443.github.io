I think that coding standards are useful for writing code with a group of people.  It allows for groups of people to collaborate with each other in a simple way.  If everyone is using the same coding standards, everyone in the group will be able to read and interpret the code of the rest of the group.  The coding standard that I am using now is one made by my college.  
I am using ESLint with Intellij to do my coding.  When you use ESLint with Intellij it marks any line that does not fit with the coding standard with a mark at the end of the line.
