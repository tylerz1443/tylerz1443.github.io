I think that coding standards are useful for writing code with a group of people.  It allows for groups of people to collaborate with each other in a simple way.  If everyone is using the same coding standards, everyone in the group will be able to read and interpret the code of the rest of the group.  The coding standard that I am using now is one made by my college.  

I am using ESLint with Intellij to do my coding.  When you use ESLint with Intellij it marks any line that does not fit with the coding standard with a mark at the end of the line.  If everything is correct, then there is a green check mark at the top right of the screen.  I like this feature, but it does not help that some parts of the coding standard are not helpful if you are just starting to write code.  Sometimes when I start coding, I will get errors because I do not have a return or use a function or variable.  This is helpful at the end of writing code, but at the beginning of writing code all it does is tell me that I have something wrong that I have not gotten to yet.
