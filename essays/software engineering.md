### User Interface Frameworks

### Agile Project Management

### Design Patterns
Design patterns are highly suggested way that you should write code.  These patterns were created by experts.  They were made so that everyone that codes can read and understand the code of someone else if they know what design pattern they used.  This uniformity also makes it easier to teach new people to code because it allows the teacher to use any code that is using the same design pattern as a template or layout for what they are teaching.  Also, it allows people to make formatting outline and auto formatting styles.  

As for using any design patterns in my coding, I don’t think that I have.  Every computer science class that I have had has had different ways that the teacher wants me to type up my code, I don’t think any of them were full design patterns.  Although, some of them seemed like they may have been parts of design patterns.  I have had classes where the teacher wanted me to comment on every little thing that I was putting into the code, and I have had classes where all the functions that a user had access to were functions that just passed data to the real function that did all the work.
