When I was younger I played a lot of videogames and roleplaying games.  As I grew up it I started to investigate how I could get in to a field of work that will let me work on these things.  I stated to investigate how these things were made.  While I was in high school it started becoming easier for people to make game of any type.  There was a rise of indie game and indie developers and I did not need to move from Hawaii and I would not need to get a specialized degree to get into one of these fields.  In the future I would like to be able to make a game by myself or with a small group of people.  I also would also be fine working for a game company, but depending on the company many of the job are not full time jobs they are just contract work.
