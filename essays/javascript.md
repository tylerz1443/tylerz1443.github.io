My first thought of JavaScript is that it is a very simple coding language compared to the other languages that I have codded in.  I have learned to code in Java, C, C++, and HTML.  JavaScript seems to easier that all the other languages other than HTML.  It was easy for me to understand the basics because I have already learned some of the coding languages that were as a base for JavaScript.  
While using JavaScript I also had some problems with the easy of use of the language.  While making some of the variables I need to make sure that I did not name my variable the same name.  Also, there are many ways in JavaScript that you can make a variable, but if you do not remember what these variables are you can make a program that does not work.
While I did have some problems with JavaScript I do like it as a coding language.  It is an easy language to learn coding with.  You can use it to make something that works with a very little effort and learning.  It can also be used to get people in to coding.
