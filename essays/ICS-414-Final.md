The project that my group worked on this semester is a hub for volunteers and organization and people looking for volunteers.  We started by dividing up the project into the front end and the back end of the project.  We then split our group into two smaller groups to work on both parts independently.  This was done so that the general layout of the site and the basics part of the site could be done quickly.  After the back end was mostly done the back end group would move over to the front end and only work on the back end if things needed to be fixed or changed.  

In the beginning of the project, we were a bit more organized because we had a list of things that need to be on the site.  After the basic parts of the site were done, we got a little disorganized because many of the new things that we needed to do were based on what we found out was not working on the parts of the site that we made.  There were not a lot of changes that were made during the reviews, most of the changes that needed to be made were some Javadoc changes.  The other time that we had a lot of work added was during the customer reviews.  After the reviews we made issues for the new things that need to be added or changed.  

At the start of the project, we used Notion to make a basic document of what we need and to make a basic layout of the entire front end and back end of the site.  After that we made mockups directly on the site.  After making mockups we edited to update the site page to have functionality that the client wanted.  Then we linked all the inputs and outputs of the site to the database after the collections were made.  

In the beginning there was a lot of work that was needed on the site, but after the initial setup we did have an up and down in the work that we needed to do.  We would have a lot of work after the customer meetings.  Then this work would go back down after the major changes were added.  In the interim of each of these meetings we would add issues that need to be adjusted based on what was not working or what needed to be changed to look better.
