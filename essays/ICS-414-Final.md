The project that my group worked on this semester is a hub for volunteers and organization and people looking for volunteers.  We started by dividing up the project into the front end and the back end of the project.  We then split our group into two smaller groups to work on both parts independently.  This was done so that the general layout of the site and the basics part of the site could be done quickly.  After the back end was mostly done the back end group would move over to the front end and only work on the back end if things needed to be fixed or changed.  
In the beginning of the project, we were a bit more organized because we had a list of things that need to be on the site.  After the basic parts of the site were done, we got a little disorganized because many of the new things that we needed to do were based on what we found out was not working on the parts of the site that we made.  There were not a lot of changes that were made during the reviews, most of the changes that needed to be made were some Javadoc changes.  The other time that we had a lot of work added was during the customer reviews.  After the reviews we made issues for the new things that need to be added or changed.
