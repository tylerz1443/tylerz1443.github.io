	While making a website it is good to use some form of UI framework.  A framework allows you to have a lot of back end work of a website without needing to program it in.  Frameworks make it easier for anyone who knows little coding to make a good website that works well on any type of browser.  
	Many types of frameworks have been updated to work on mobile.   This is a real help because there are old sites that use a type of framework but were made before a lot of people had a device that displayed sites on a mobile version.  It also makes it easier for someone to make a copy of a site or to copy specific parts of a site without a lot of coding need for the new parts.  
A good example of this is the site for my job.  When started work one of the first things that I had to do was to take the navbar from the main pages and put it in to every page.  The navbar is a bar that always stays on the top of the page as you scroll through the page.  Although this is something that is complicated to program without using a framework, with a framework all I had to do was copy and paste the entire navbar from one page to the other, then make a few changes to navbar to customize it to the current page.
