summary: My eagle scout service project, makeing a compost bin. 
---

My eagle service project was making a compost bin for my high school.   The compost bin was for one of my teachers because they were trying to make a new style of teaching.  They wanted to make a more project and hands-on style of learning instead of lecture and test style of learning.  It took an few months to get all the materials for the project.  

The project was completed in one day.  It started in the morning and went till midafternoon.  There were about 15 boys and 5 leaders helping me with my project.  The project went well, there were no problems that I ran into.  The only problem that I had with it is a few months after I did my project my school moved locations and I had to move the bin, which involved getting some people from my boy scout troop and moving the bin to its new location.
