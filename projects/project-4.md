summary: Final project for my computer science class.  Made a website that listed all the food that is available on the University of Hawaii at Manoa campus.
---

I was in a three man team to make a web app that shows all of the available food at any time on my campus.  I was first assigned to make the user profile page and the user functionality.  I made a simple user page that would take the users name, food prefference, and an image of the user.  The user page will also have a place to display the user's saved vendors on campus.  I was able to do most of this, but I need some help from one of my other team mates to fix some of the formating of the pages that I made.

I was also assigned to work on the vendor pages for the site after the person that was assigned to it was not working on it.  I did not have a lot of time to work on this so most of the work that I did was to make the pages work, and to have the pages look nice.
