summary: ICS 211 group project to make a minesweeper-type game in java with graphic. 
---

Minesweeper is an old puzzle game.  The object of the game is to clear all the "mines" that are on the designated grid.  There have been many iterations of this game that have been made over the years.  This is a very simple puzzle game that can be played by anyone and has a very large popularity with many kinds of people.  

The minesweeper game that I worked on was a group project for ICS 211.  I was in a group of three people.  The other people worked on the game itself while I mostly focused on the UI for the game.  I worked on the menus and the transition between the menus. I also worked a little on the graphics.
