---

A Choose Your Own Adventure game is a type of roleplaying game.  In it you pick a choice form a group of option based on what was told to you previously.  It started out as book, but when computer came along it quickly moved to be videogames.  
The project that I worked on was a group project to make a Choose Your Own Adventure game.  The game that we made was a superhero story.  I worked on the graphical interface and the transitions between the pages of the story.  I also help a few of the other people in the group because they were having trouble with their part of the project.
