summary: A Choose Your Own Adventure game made for a ICS 111 project.  
---

A Choose Your Own Adventure game is a type of roleplaying game.  In it you pick a choice form a group of option based on what was told to you previously.  It started out as book, but when computer came along it quickly moved to be videogames.

The project that I worked on was a group project to make a Choose Your Own Adventure game.  The game that we made was a superhero story.  I worked on the graphical interface and the transitions between the pages of the story and for all the elements in each page.  I also help a few of the other people in the group because they were having trouble with their part of the project.  

The story that we made was a simple superhero story.  It contained 20 or so screens with choices, and there were 3 endings.  We had different bubbles based on what the statements were and different layer for the comic book style illustration panels, so that we could lessen the amount of time that the we fully cleared the full page.
